# Local Development Docker Compose - Autogenerated

This folder and its contents are auto-generated.

Changes made to this folder WILl BE lost if `earthly +local` is run again.

IF changes are needed to be made, it is suggested that the `autogen` directory be copied to another
folder in the `<repo>/local` directory.

This will ensure your local edits are preserved.

It will also make it easy for you to check for differences between your local edits and the
autogenerated docker-compose configuration.

The source for these files comes from templates held in `<repo>/containers/dev-local`.
If persistent edits to this configuration are desired, they should be made there and the
changes push upstream if they are generally applicable.
